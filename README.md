# adhoc

## Goal of this repository/library 

We often have to do the same thing for each analysis. 

- create a jupyter notebook and import numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
- put *watermark* to log your environment
- count the missing values in the data set  
- check the data types and correct them if they are wrong
- train math model with an usual grid parameter.
- draw the ROC curve of the trained model
- etc.

This module provides generic classes which can be applied almost everywhere
and documentation about

- how to prepare your analysis environment.
- hints of useful commands
